Hi! I'm Ashish Gaurav and this is my personal page. I tried my best with grid, tables. In my website I also added a favicon file. I tried to make it better as much I can.

There are 4 tabs
1. Home (index.html)
2. About (about.html)
3. Qualification(Achievements.html)
4. Contact Me!(contact.html)

I also make a form in contact tab. Some codes that I used apart from lectures are
<a href="mailto:ashish.gaurav2003@gmail.com"> (to take action mail).
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png" sizes="32x32"> (for inserting a favicon).
and few more commands (if i forget to mention).
I also used some extra css commands that I found while using Visual Studio Code.
